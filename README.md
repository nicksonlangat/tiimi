### MODULE BREAKDOWN

The following is a description of what each module does.

### ACCOUNTS
This module is responsible for the registration authentication and authorization of users in to the platform.
The registration process is multi-step:
- First the user enters their details (email, first_name, last_name, phone_number, password)
- They receive a verification OTP to activate their newly created accounts.
- They then login and proceed to the next step.
- They are taken to a clinic creation screen where they are asked to enter clinic info(name, location, clinic phone_number, clinic_email)
- If all info is correct, the clinic is created with the user as the owner.

##### ORDERS

This module allows the clinic owner to:

- Create a new order request.
- Send order request as an email to the vendor/supplier.
- Mark an order as complete, cancelled or pending. Note that marking an order as complete means the clinic has received all order items and the order items get marked individually as received. The reverse is true.
- Mark individual order items as received. Note that marking all individual order items as received will marke the status of the parent order as complete. The opposite is true.
